                    Admittedly i think that you boys have done a pretty great job of coming out with some snazzy names, it isn't my forte honestly to be creative in this way
                    however i think that the shorter, more sweet, and punchy names are more memorable, particularly when using pre-existing words. Literally every time i try to think about it i just think
                    sympatico and that is obviously terrible.

                <p class="roletext constants">Seeing as everyone has a vested interest in audio design I am happy to opt out of this area, I would absolutely love to write
                    code for the game, particularly regarding backend but quite happy to work on frontend aspects when needed. With that in mind it's clear that we won't be 
                    focusing on artefacts until further into the process, i would therefore be quite happy to work WITH you guys on designing game elements but i feel like i am
                    not as experienced in design as you guys so i would need to be offered some patience when working on the project.

                    Actually i think that talking about my favourite games is kinda redundant so i'll talk about features i enjoy or dislike with examples.</br></br>
                    I much prefer efficiency and smooth controls over visually pleasing animations/ realism: case and point RDR2 (fantastic game but it's a chore to watch the same animations
                    over and over again) Like i don't have all day red dead can you sum up your animations in less than 5 seconds? Also player freedom is great in an open world, but don't
                    try to trick me into believing that i have freedom when you are clearly holding my hand</br></br>
                    Difficulty for me in video games is of great importance, i very much dislike reaching a plateau of expertise in games where you feel like you are no longer being
                    challenged. Whilst i like the idea of having different difficulty for different players (accessibility), it's hard to realise your vision whilst catering for what is 
                    in effect different games. Dark souls is an obvious but flawed example, there are constant peaks and troughs in difficulty and it feels rewarding to overcome obstacles.
                    However one aspect of the souls series that has always troubled me is the inclusion of "useless items". Player choice is great but don't bung up inventories with useless
                    shit that no one is ever going to use. </br></br>
                    On a similar note, i enjoy being taught new mechanics throughout a game, perhaps not in the late game, but it's always nice to be learning. Breath of the Wild does this
                    very well by introducing new ideas as you progress through the game with armor upgrades/ new abilities in a way that doesn't overwhelm players.

                <h1 class="subtitles">Inspiration and focus</h1>
                <p class="gamestext constants">I always harp on about the importance of audio design, and i think often that it can be one of the main reasons that alot of games
                    click with me. Outside of this i feel that focusing on features of a game is a general waste of our time as a new company, there should be one
                    main focus when creating any game and that is "is it fun to play?". When watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qfx9eoB-88">this video about bungie/343</a> 
                    (tl;dw spectacle is great but meaningful and fun gameplay is what keeps players coming back) it always strikes me that it's easy to lose sight of why people play in 
                    the first place, so even if our products aren't squeaky clean/ beautiful if they are enjoyable we're 90% of the way there.</br>
                    I am going on a bit here but from a visual standpoint simplicity is king. Often just a good balance of colours and clean assets can be as enjoyable to look 
                    at as AAA games. i think of forager and see beauty in its clever visuals and also understand that it is achievable for us to one day create a product like this.
